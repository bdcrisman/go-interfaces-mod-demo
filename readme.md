# golang interfaces and modules demo

## Just for fun?
- Modules are have been around for a few years but, I've rarely used them. After piecing together multiple forums and YouTube videos, I was able to get it working.
- Hopefully, this can help someone else out as well.
- It's a lot more simple than I thought :)
